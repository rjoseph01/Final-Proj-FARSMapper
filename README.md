    <h4>Purpose</h4>
    <p>The Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) nationwide census for counting road accidents with motor vehicles resulting in at least one fatality. This website provies a means for exploring fatal accidents that occurred in the United States in 2014 and 2015 through viewing the location of accidents on a map and the selection of various filters pertaining to each accident.</p>
    <h4>Limitations</h4>
    <p>This website only displays fatal accidents that have geographic data. Because only 29,896 of the 30,057 fatal accidents in 2014 and 31,959 of the 32,166 fatal accidents in 2015 have geographic data associated with them, 207 accidents in 2015 and 161 accidents in 2014 with no geography have been removed from the database underpinning this website. However, I am confident that the 99.5% of fatal accidents that are included are a sufficient sample for the purposes of exploration and analysis. </p>
    <p>At the moment, some functions have been omitted from this website due to time and other constraints. These functions include the ability to select individual accidents with the mouse to view individual level data, the ability to select more than one filter at a time, and the inclusion of more variables from the FARS database. I hope to update the website to include these pieces for 2015 and other years in the near future.</p>
    <p>Please feel free to email me if you find any bugs, errors, or issues in the website. I am already aware that the map may load slowly, especially when you first start using it. <b>robert.joseph@nyu.edu</b></p>
